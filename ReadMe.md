Note: Please run easyClock on Macs with M-series chips. This application is unsigned, so I recommend launching it by "right-clicking" the app in your "Applications folder" for the first time,
and selecting “Open” from the menu. A warning dialog may appear—please click “Open” again to proceed. The system will quarantine and verify the app when it starts, which may take 30–60 seconds.
